## Introduction
This repository showcases my work as I progress through different tasks in full stack development. From building basic HTML forms to handling form validation and setting up Node.js servers, each task represents a step toward mastering full stack web development.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express
- EJS (for dynamic HTML rendering)
- Body-parser (for handling form data)

## Tasks Overview

### Beginner Level
- **HTML Forms**: Created basic forms for user input.
- **Node.js Server**: Set up a basic Node.js server using Express.
- **Form Handling**: Implemented server-side and client-side validation for form submissions.

### Intermediate Level
- **CSS Styling**: Enhanced the UI with inline styles and responsive design.
- **Advanced Form Validation**: Implemented more complex validation rules for form inputs.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Added interactive elements to the web page.

### Advanced Level
- **API Integration**: Worked with RESTful APIs to manage data.
- **Database Integration**: Integrated a database (like MongoDB) for storing and retrieving user data.
- **User Authentication**: Added user authentication to the app for secure login and data management.
